# Technical Debt Note 1
## Description
The tech debt note cleanup process needs an AI-driven strategy to:
1. Analyze note contents and determine priority/relevance
2. Consider note age and related code locations
3. Implement a scoring system for note importance

This should be implemented as a separate cleanup agent that can be triggered when needed.
